  <p class='subtitle'>Well, my dad was a farmer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Like everybody else back then.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Of course, he didn't start that way.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Computer says you're too tight.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Nah, I got this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Crossing the Straights.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Shutting it down, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Shutting it all down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No, I need power up!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I thought you were the ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There are no such things</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>as ghosts, babe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa says you can get ghosts.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>too close to being one himself. Back to bed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Were you dreaming about the crash?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The wheat had died.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The blight came and we had to burn it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And we still had corn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We had acres of corn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But... mostly we had dust.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I guess I can't describe it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was just constant.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just that steady blow of dirt.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We wore... little strips of sheet...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>sometimes over our nose and mouth...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so that we wouldn't breathe</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so much of it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, when we set the table,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we always set the plate upside-down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Glasses or cups,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>whatever it was upside-down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Herbicide Resistance 101.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Check?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yes, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not at the table, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad, can you fix this?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What the heck did you do to my lander?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Wasn't me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let me guess. It was your ghost?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It knocked it off.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It keeps knocking books off.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dad, tell her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You said science was about admitting</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what we don't know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- She's got you there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, Murph,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you want to talk science?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, you got to go further.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You got to record the facts, analyze,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>get to the how and the why...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>then present your conclusions. Deal?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Deal.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- All right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Have a good day at school.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hold up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not grandparent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Slow down, turbo!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That's not a dust storm.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Nelson's torching his whole crop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Blight?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're saying</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it's the last harvest for okra.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Ever.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He should've planted corn</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>like the rest of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's single.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's that supposed to mean?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Repopulating the earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Start pulling your weight, young man.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why don't you start</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>minding your own business, old man?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, Murph, give me second.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Third.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Find a gear, dumb-ass.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Grind it!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Shut it, Tom!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What'd you do, Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- She didn't do nothing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Blew a tire is all.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Murphy's Law.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Shut up!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Grab the spare, Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That is the spare.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get the patch kit!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How am I supposed to patch it out here?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You got to figure it out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm not always gonna be here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to help you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's going on, Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why did you and Mom name me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>after something that's bad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We didn't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Murphy's Law?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murphy's Law doesn't mean</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that something bad will happen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What it means is</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>whatever can happen will happen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And that sounded just fine with us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Whoa!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get in.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get in, let's go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What about the flat tire?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's an Indian Air Force drone.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Solar cells could power an entire farm.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Take the wheel, Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go, go, go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Keep that aimed right at it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Right at it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Stay on it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here we go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Whoa.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nice one, Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dad!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Tom!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You told me to keep driving.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, I guess that answers the old</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We lost it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No, we didn't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Want to give it a whirl?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This way.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's lay her down right there</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>at the edge of the reservoir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nicely done.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How long you think it's been up there?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Delhi Mission Control</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>went down, same as ours...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- ...ten years ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So for ten years?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why did it come down so low?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I don't know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe the sun cooked its brain</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or it was looking for something.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Give me a large flatblade.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What are you gonna do with it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna give it something</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>socially responsible to do...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>like drive a combine.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Can't we just let it go?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It wasn't hurting anybody.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This thing needs to learn how to adapt,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph... like the rest of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How's this work? You guys come with?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've got class. This one needs to wait.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What did you do?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- They'll tell you about it in there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Am I gonna be mad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Not with me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Just please try not to.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey. Relax.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I got this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Little late, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah, we had a flat.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I guess you had to stop off</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>at the Asian fighter plane store.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, actually, sir,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that's a surveillance drone.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>With outstanding solar cells.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's Indian.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Take a seat.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we got Tom's scores back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's going to make an excellent farmer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, he's got a knack for it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What about college?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The university only takes a handful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They don't have the resources to...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I still pay my taxes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where's that money go?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's no more armies.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, it doesn't go to the university.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You're ruling my son out for college now?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- The kid's 15.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's your waistline? About what, 32?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- About a 33 inseam?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It takes two numbers to measure your ass</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but only one to measure my son's future?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're a well-educated man, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And a trained pilot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And an engineer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, well, right now</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we don't need more engineers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We didn't run out of television screens</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and planes. We ran out of food.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The world needs farmers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Good farmers, like you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Uneducated farmers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're a caretaker generation, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And things are getting better.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Are we done here, sir?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph is a great kid.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's really bright.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But she's been having</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a little trouble lately.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She brought this in to show the students.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The section on the lunar landings.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She always loved the pictures.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's an old federal textbook. We've</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>replaced them with the corrected versions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Corrected?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Explaining how the Apollo missions</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You don't believe we went to the moon?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Soviets bankrupted themselves</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>pouring resources...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- into rockets and other useless machines.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- "Useless machines."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If we don't want a repeat of the excess</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we need to teach our kids about this planet,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>not tales of leaving it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One of those useless machines</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they used to make was called an MRI.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If we had any of those left,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the doctors would've been able to find...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the cyst in my wife's brain</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>before she died instead of afterwards.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then she'd have been the one</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>listening to this instead of me...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>which would have been a good thing,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because she was always...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the calmer one.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But Murph got into a fistfight</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with several of her classmates over this...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to bring you in and see what ideas...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you might have for dealing</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with her behavior on the home front.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, you know what?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's a game tomorrow night.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's going through</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a bit of a baseball phase.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Her favorite team is playing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's gonna be candy and soda and...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think I'll take her to that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How'd it go?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I got you suspended.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is Cooper. Go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Coop, those combines you rebuilt</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>went haywire.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just reset the controllers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I did that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now you should come take a look.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One by one they've been peeling off</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the fields and heading over.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Something's interfering</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with the compass.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Magnetism or some such.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nothing special about which book.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've been working on it, like you said.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I counted the spaces.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In case the ghost</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is trying to communicate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm trying Morse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Morse?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dots and dashes, used...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I know what Morse code is, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I just don't think your bookshelf's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>trying to talk to you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Had to reset every compass clock and GPS</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to offset for the anomaly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Which is?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I don't know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If the house was built</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>on magnetic ore...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we'd have seen this the first time</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we switched on the tractor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I hear your meeting at the school</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>didn't go so well.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Heh. You heard?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's like we've forgotten</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>who we are, Donald.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When I was a kid...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it felt like they made something new</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>every day. Some...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>gadget or idea.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Like every day was Christmas.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But six billion people...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just try to imagine that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And every last one of them</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>trying to have it all.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This world isn't so bad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And Tom will do just fine.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're the one who doesn't belong.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Born 40 years too late,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or 40 years too early.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My daughter knew it, God bless her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And your kids know it. Especially Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, we used to look up in the sky</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and wonder...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>at our place in the stars.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now we just look down and worry</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about our place in the dirt.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, you were good at something...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and you never got a chance</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to do anything with it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You didn't expect this dirt</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that was giving you this food...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to turn on you like that</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and destroy you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In April... I believe I'm right...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Fifteenth of April, I think.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This happened about 1:30 when that thing...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>came off the top of that canyon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In my day, we had real ballplayers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Who are these bums?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In my day, people were too busy</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>fighting over food to even play baseball.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I want a hot dog.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>School says you're gonna follow</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in my footsteps.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think that's great.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You think that's great?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You hate farming, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa said.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa said?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Listen, all that matters</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is how you feel about it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I like what you do.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I like our farm.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're gonna be great at it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's get out of here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, it's a doozy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, gang, let's mask up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Tom? Murph? Check?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grab your pillow.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're sleeping in with Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's not a ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You want to clean that up</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when you've finished praying to it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Thick is one, thin is zero.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Coordinates.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nope.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here we go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Thirty-three.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can't miss this!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa will be back</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in a couple hours, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But you don't know</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what you're gonna find.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is why I can't take you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa will be home in a while.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Tell him I'll call him on the radio.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Jesus.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What are you doing?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Heh-heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, you think this is funny?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You wouldn't be here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if it wasn't for me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Make yourself useful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think this is the end of the road.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's my girl.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Step away!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't shoot! I'm not armed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My daughter's in the car.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't be afraid.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How did you find this place?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where's my daughter?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You had the coordinates for this facility</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>marked on your map. Where did you get them?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where's my daughter?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't make me take you down again.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Sit down!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, you still think</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you're a Marine, pal?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Marines don't exist anymore.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Where did you find those coordinates?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But you don't look much</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>like a lawnmower.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Think I'll turn you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, you won't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, back down, please.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know, you're taking a risk</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>using ex-military security.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're old, and their control units</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>are unpredictable.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's what the government could spare.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Who are you?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I knew a Dr. Brand once.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He was a professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What makes you think I'm not?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Wasn't near as cute, either.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Please, Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't have any idea what this is.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now I'm scared for my daughter</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and want her by my side.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You give me that,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll tell you anything you want to know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get the principals and the girl</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in the conference room, please.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Must have a very smart mother.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's pretty clear</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you don't want any visitors.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So why don't you just let us back up from</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>your fence and we'll be on our way?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's not that simple.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Well, sure, it is.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know anything about you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know anything about this place.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes, you do.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hello, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Professor Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Explain to me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>how you found this facility.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>upon it. We were on a salvage run...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're sitting in the best-kept secret</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in the world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nobody stumbles in here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nobody stumbles out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, please.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooperate with these people.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's kind of hard to explain.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We learned these coordinates</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from an anomaly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What sort of anomaly?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I hesitate to term it supernatural,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but it definitely wasn't scientific.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're going to have to be specific,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Mr. Cooper. Right now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What sort of gravitational anomaly?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where was this?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now, I'm real happy that you're excited</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about gravity, bud...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but you're not getting any answers</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from us until I get assurances.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Assurances?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Like, that we're getting out of here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Don't you know who we are, Coop?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No, professor, I don't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know my father, Professor Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're NASA.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- NASA?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- NASA.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The same NASA you flew for.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I heard they shut you down, sir...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for refusing to drop bombs</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from the stratosphere onto starving people.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When they realized</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that killing other people was...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>not a long-term solution,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>then they needed us back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- In secret.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why secret?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because public opinion wouldn't allow</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>spending on space exploration.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not while you're struggling</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to put food on the table.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Blight.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now there's just corn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And we're growing more</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>than we ever have.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But like the potatoes in Ireland</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the corn will die.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Soon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We'll find a way, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We always have.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Driven by the unshakable faith</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the Earth is ours.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not just ours, no. But it is our home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We don't even breathe nitrogen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Blight does. And as it thrives,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>our air gets less and less oxygen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The last people to starve</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>will be the first to suffocate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And your daughter's generation...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>will be the last to survive on Earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if she could take a nap in my office.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah. Thank you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Alright...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>now you need to tell me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what your plan is to save the world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're not meant to save the world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're meant to leave it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Rangers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The last components of our one versatile ship</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in orbit, the Endurance.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Our final expedition.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You sent people out there</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>looking for a new home?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Lazarus missions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh, that sounds cheerful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Lazarus came back from the dead.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Sure, but he had to die</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in the first place.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's not a planet in our solar system</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that could sustain life...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and the nearest star's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>over a thousand years away.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That doesn't even qualify as futile.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where'd you send them?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can't tell you anymore</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>unless you agree to pilot this craft.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You're the best pilot we ever had.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I barely left the stratosphere.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This team never left the simulator.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We need a pilot, and this is the mission</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that you were trained for.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Without even knowing it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>An hour ago, you didn't even know</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I was alive. You were going anyway.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We had no choice.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But something sent you here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- They chose you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Who's "they"?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How long would I be gone?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hard to know. Years?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I've got kids, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Get out there and save them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Who's "they"?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We started detecting gravitational</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>anomalies almost 50 years ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Mostly small distortions to our instruments</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in the upper atmosphere.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In fact, I believe</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you encountered one yourself.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, over the Straights.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My crash.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Something tripped my fly-by-wire.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Exactly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But of all these anomalies,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the most significant is this:</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Out near Saturn...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a disturbance of space-time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Is that a Wormhole?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It appeared 48 years ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And it leads where?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Another galaxy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A wormhole's not</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a naturally occurring phenomenon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Someone placed it there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"They"?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And whoever they are,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they appear to be looking out for us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It came along right as we needed it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They've put potentially habitable worlds</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>right within our reach.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Twelve, in fact,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from our initial probes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You sent probes into that?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We sent people into it. Ten years ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Lazarus missions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Twelve possible worlds,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>twelve Ranger launches carrying...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the bravest humans ever to live...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Each person's landing pod</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>had enough life support for two years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But they could use hibernation</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to stretch that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>making observations on organics</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>over a decade or more.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Their mission was to assess their world,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and if it showed potential...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>then they could send out a signal,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And what if the world</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>didn't show promise?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hence the bravery.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You don't have the resources</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to visit all 12.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Data transmission back through</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the Wormhole is rudimentary.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>some clue as to which worlds have potential.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And one system shows promise.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One. That's a bit</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of a long shot, isn't it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One system with three potential worlds?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No long shot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So if we find a home...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- ...then what?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That's the long shot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's a Plan A and a Plan B.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did you notice anything strange</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about the launch chamber?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This entire facility's a centrifuge.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Some kind of vehicle. A space station?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Both. Plan A.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How do you get it off the ground?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The first gravitational anomalies</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>changed everything.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Suddenly we knew</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that harnessing gravity was real.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So I started working on a theory</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and we started building this station.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But you haven't solved it yet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's why there's Plan B.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The problem is gravity. How to get</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a viable amount of human life off the planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is one way.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Plan B: A population bomb.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Over 5,000 fertilized eggs</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>weighing in at just under 900 kilos.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How would you raise them?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>With equipment on board,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we incubate the first 10.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>After that, with surrogacy,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the growth becomes exponential.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Within 30 years,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we could have a colony of hundreds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The real difficulty with colonization</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is genetic diversity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This takes care of that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But what about the people here?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You just...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You give up on them? My kids?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How far have you got?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Almost there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're asking me to hang everything...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>on an almost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm asking you to trust me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Find us a new home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And by the time you return...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I will have solved</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the problem of gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I give you my word.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go away!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go! If you're leaving, just go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This world was never enough</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for you, was it, Coop?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What, because heading out there</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is what I feel like I was born to do?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And it excites me? Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, that does not make it wrong.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It might. Don't trust the right thing</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>done for the wrong reason.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The why of the thing,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that's the foundation.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And the foundation's solid.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We farmers, we sit here every year</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when the rains fail and we say:</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"Next year."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, next year ain't gonna save us,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>nor the one after that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This world's a treasure, Donald,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Mankind was born on Earth,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it was never meant to die here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Tom will be all right, but you got</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to make things right with Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I will.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Without making promises</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you don't know you can keep.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have to talk to me, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I need to fix this before I go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then I'll keep it broken</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so you have to stay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>After you kids came along, your mom said</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>something to me I never quite understood.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She said, "Now...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we're just here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to be memories for our kids."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I think that now I understand</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what she meant.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Once you're a parent,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you're the ghost of your children's future.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You said ghosts didn't exist.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's right, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, look at me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can't be your ghost right now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I need to exist.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They chose me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, they chose me. You saw.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're the one who led me to them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's exactly why you can't go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I figured out the message.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- One word. Know what it is?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"Stay."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It says, "Stay," Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You don't believe me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look at the books! Look at this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It says, "Stay."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why...? You're not listening!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It says, "Stay!"</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No, I'm coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- When?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One for you, one for me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>traveling near the speed of light, or...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>near a black hole...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>time's gonna change for me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's gonna run more slowly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When we get back...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we're gonna compare.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Time will run differently for us?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>By the time I get back,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we might even be the same age, you and me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"What?" Imagine that!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Aw, Murph...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have no idea when you're coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No idea at all!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, don't...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't make me leave like this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on, Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't make me leave like this, Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I love you. Forever. You hear me?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I love you forever, and I'm coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How'd it go?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Fine.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just fine.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I love you, Tom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Travel safe?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You look after our place</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for me, all right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You mean your truck?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll make sure they bring it back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look after my kids, Donald!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dad!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- ...nine...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>...eight...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- seven...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dad!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>...six...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>five, main engine start, four...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>three...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>two...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>one. Booster ignition and...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All engines look good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Beginning roll program.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Prepare for stage one separation.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Stage one.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There is Mach 1.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Everybody good?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They gave him a humor setting</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so he'd fit in better with his unit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He thinks it relaxes us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A giant sarcastic robot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What a great idea!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have a cue light I can use</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when I'm joking if you like.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That'd probably help.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You can use it to find your way back</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What's your humor setting, TARS?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That's 100 percent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's bring it on down to 75, please.</p>

  <p class='subtitle'>My kids. Your father.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're going to be spending</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a lot of time together.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We should learn to talk.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And when not to.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just being honest.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't think you need to be that honest.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ninety percent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ninety percent?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Absolute honesty isn't always</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the most diplomatic,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>nor the safest form of communication</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with emotional beings.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We are coming up on the Endurance.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Twelve minutes out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. Taking control.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Approaching module port, 500 meters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's all you, Doyle.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I feel good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Take us home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Lock.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Target locked.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Well done.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Okay, helmets on.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Good job.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Door's not charging. Never mind.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, you should have control.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Control here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Communication with ring module active.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, wow.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's initiate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Are we ready to spin?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Just a sec.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hello, CASE.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hello, TARS.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, we're all set.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, let's do it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Thirty percent of spin.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One G.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How's gravity treating you back there?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly? Hey, you okay?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You all right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, I just need a minute.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think we have some Dramamine</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or maybe in the cryo-beds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll just be a sec.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey, Brand?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Bring a lot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Heh-heh-heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Amelia, be safe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I will, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It looks good for your trajectory.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've calculated two years to Saturn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's a lot of Dramamine.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look after my family,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>will you, please, sir?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We'll be waiting for you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when you get back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A little older, a little wiser,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but happy to see you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do not go gentle into that good night</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Old age should burn</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and rave at close of day</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Rage, rage against</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the dying of the light</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Though wise men at their end</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Know dark is right</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because their words had forked</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No lightning they</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do not go gentle into that good night</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Rage, rage against</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the dying of the light</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You good?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, thank you, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here. Pills.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So alone.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We have each other.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann had it worse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, I mean them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's a perfect planet,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and we won't find another one like her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, it's not like looking</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for a new condo.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The human race is going to be...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>adrift...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>desperate for a rock it can cling to</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>while it catches its breath.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We need to find that rock.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And our three prospects are at the edge</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of what might sustain human life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Laura Miller's planet is first.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Laura started our biology program.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- COOPER:</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Wolf Edmunds is here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Tell me about Edmunds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>None of them had families?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. No attachments. My father insisted.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They all knew the odds against</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>ever seeing another human being again.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm hoping we can surprise</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>at least three of them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How about Mann?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dr. Mann?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's remarkable. He's the best of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He inspired 11 people to follow him</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>on the loneliest journey in human history.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Scientists, explorers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's what I love.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know, out there we face great odds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Death, but...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>not evil.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You don't think nature can be evil?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. Formidable. Frightening. But...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>...no, not evil.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is a lion evil</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because it rips a gazelle to shreds?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just what we take with us, then.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This crew represents</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the best of humanity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Even me?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There you go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Don't stay up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'll be there in a minute.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just remember, Coop,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you are literally wasting your breath.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, TARS? Let's go over</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that trajectory one more time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eight months to Mars.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Counter-orbital slingshot around.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Fourteen months to Saturn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nothing's changed on that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just let me ask you something.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I wouldn't know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But not a poker face, Slick.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, guys.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad's about to go down for the long nap.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So I wanted to give you an update.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Earth looks amazing from here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You can't see any of the dust. Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I really hope you guys are doing great.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I know you're gonna get this message.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Professor Brand's assured me that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>he's gonna get it to you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Know that I love you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Is it him?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I don't think so, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You must be Donald.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hello, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why are you in my dad's truck?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He wanted me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to bring it for your brother.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He sent you a message.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's pretty upset with him for leaving.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If you record any messages,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph is a bright spark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe I should fan the flame.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's already making fools</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of her teachers.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So maybe she should come</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and make a fool out of you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- So where are they?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Heading for Mars.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The next time you hear from Cooper,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they'll be coming up on Saturn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>...administration wants me to repeat</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Plant Pathology. Which sucks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But they said I could start</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Advanced Agriculture a year early.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, I got to go, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hope you're safe up there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Sorry, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I asked Murph to say hi,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but she's as stubborn as her old man.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll try again next time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You all right, Rom?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This gets to me, Cooper. This. This.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and then nothing...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>out there for millions of miles</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>won't kill us in seconds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know that some of the finest...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>solo yachtsmen in the world</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>don't know how to swim?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They don't know how.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're explorers, Rom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is our boat. Here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is from the... relay probe?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was in orbit around the Wormhole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is the Wormhole,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and every time we'd come around...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we would receive images</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from the other side of the foreign galaxy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Like swinging a periscope around.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Exactly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So we got a pretty good idea</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what we're gonna find on the other side?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Navigationally.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the Wormhole in about three hours.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Coop?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Can we stop the spinning?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because we're close enough</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to see it now?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Thanks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Say it, don't spray it, Rom. It's a sphere.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Of course it is. What, you...?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You thought it would just be a hole?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, it's just that all the illustrations</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've ever seen, they...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In the illustrations,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they're trying to show you how it works.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So they say you want to go</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from here to there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But it's too far, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So a Wormhole bends space like this,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so you can take a shortcut through...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a higher dimension.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, so...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to show that,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they've turned three-dimensional space</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>into two dimensions, a circle.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's a circle in three dimensions?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- A sphere.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Exactly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A spherical hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But who put it there?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Who do we have to thank?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm not thanking anybody until we</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>get out of here in one piece, Rom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Any trick to this, Doyle?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No one knows.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The others made it, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>At least some of them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Everybody ready to say goodbye</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to our solar system?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To our galaxy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here we go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The controls won't work here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're passing through the bulk.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's space beyond our three dimensions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All you can do is record and observe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What is that?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I think it's them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Distorting space-time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't! Don't!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What was that?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The first handshake.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So the lost communications came through.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- The relay on this side cached them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So years of basic data.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No real surprises.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>as has Dr. Mann's.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Edmunds' went down three years ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Transmitter failure?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>right until it went dark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But Miller's still</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>looks good though, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Because she's coming up fast.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- DOYLE:</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>With one complication.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The planet is much closer to Gargantua</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>than we thought.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Gargantua?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's what we're calling the black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>both orbit it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And Miller's is on the horizon?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- As a basketball around a hoop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Landing there takes us</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>dangerously close.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And a black hole that big</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>has a huge gravitational pull.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look, I could swing around</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that neutron star to decelerate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, it's not that. It's time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The gravity on that planet will slow</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>our clock compared to Earth's drastically.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How bad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Every hour we spend</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>on that planet will be...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>seven years back on Earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Jesus.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, that's relativity, folks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, we can't just drop down</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>there without...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, we have a mission.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and our mission Plan A is...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to find a planet that can habitate</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the people that are living on Earth right now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You can't just think about your family.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now you have to think bigger than that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I am thinking about my family</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and millions of other families, okay?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Plan A does not work if the people on Earth</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>are dead by the time we pull it off.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. It doesn't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's why there's a Plan B.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. Cooper's right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We need to think of time as a resource,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just like oxygen and food.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Going down it's gonna cost us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, look.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann's data is promising,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but it's gonna take months to get there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And Edmunds', it's even further.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is very promising. It's water, it's organics...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You don't find that every day.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No, you don't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And just think about the resources,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>including time...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that would be spent</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>trying to get back here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Romilly...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>...how far off from Miller's planet do we</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>have to be to stay out of the time shift?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just back from the cusp.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, which is here,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just outside of Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here's Gargantua.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here's Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Instead of taking the Endurance</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>into orbit around Miller's planet...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>which would conserve fuel,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but we would lose a lot of time...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what if we take a wider orbit</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>around Gargantua,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>parallel with Miller's planet</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>outside of this time shift, to here?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then we take the Ranger down,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we get Miller, we get her samples.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We come back, we analyze, we debrief.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're in, we're out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We lose a little fuel,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but we save a whole lot of time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That'll work.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That's good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's no time for monkey business</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or chit-chat down there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So, TARS,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you should definitely stay here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE, you're with me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Anyone else can stay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If we're talking about a couple years,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I could use the time to research gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Observations from the Wormhole,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that's gold to Professor Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You got it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I wouldn't leave you behind...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You ready, CASE?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yup.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You don't say much, do you?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- TARS talks plenty for both of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Detach.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Romilly, are you reading these forces?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's unbelievable.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A literal heart of darkness.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If we could just see</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the collapsed star inside...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the singularity, yeah,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we'd solve gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And we can't get anything from it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Nothing escapes that horizon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not even light.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- The answer's there, just no way to see it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- There's Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Goodbye, Ranger.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is fast for atmospheric entry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Should we use the thrusters to slow?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to save some fuel.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Air brake?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We want to get down fast, don't we?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We want to get there in one piece.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hang on.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Brand, Doyle, get ready.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We should ease!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hands where I can see them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The only time I went down was</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when a machine was easing at the wrong time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- A little caution...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper, it's too damn fast!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I got this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Should I disable the feedback?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No. I need to feel the air.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Here we go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's just water!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The stuff of life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Twelve hundred meters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Do we have a fix on the beacon?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Got it!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Can you maneuver?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'll need to shave some speed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Everybody hang on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Seven hundred.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>On my cue, CASE. On my cue.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Five hundred meters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Fire!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Very graceful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But very efficient.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What are you waiting for? Let's go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go, go, go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Seven years per hour here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's make it count!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This way.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>About 200 meters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The gravity's punishing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Been floating through space too long?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>110% Earth gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on. Come on.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- There's nothing here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Should be right here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If the signal's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>coming from here, then...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Her beacon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Wreckage.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where's the rest?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Towards the mountains!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Those aren't mountains.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're waves.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That one's moving away from us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We need the recorder.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're not leaving without her data.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get back here now! We do not have time!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The second wave is coming!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're in the middle of a swell.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, I got it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get your ass back to the Ranger now!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand, get back here now!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, Cooper, go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, go. I can't make it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- CASE, go get her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Get up. Get up, Brand!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go, go! Go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm not gonna make it!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on, CASE has her!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get back here, Doyle!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get to the hatch!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go, go! Go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Shit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Manually overriding inside hatch!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper! Wait!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The engines are flooded!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna have to shut her down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Holy shit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hang on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- CASE, what's the problem?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Goddamn it!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And I told you to get your ass back here!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- One of us was thinking about the mission!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You were thinking about getting home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I was trying to do the right thing!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Can you tell that to Doyle?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- CASE, how much time?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Forty-five to an hour.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The stuff of life?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's this gonna cost us, Brand?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A lot. Decades.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What happened to Miller?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Judging by the wreckage, she was</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>broken up by a wave soon after impact.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How's the wreckage stayed together</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>after all these years?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because of the time slippage.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>On this planet's time,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>she just landed hours ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She probably just died minutes ago.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The data Doyle received was just</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the initial status echoing endlessly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, we are not prepared for this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You eggheads have the survival skills</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of a Boy Scout troop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, we got this far on our brains.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Farther than any human in history.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, not far enough!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And now we're stuck here till there</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>won't be anyone left on Earth to save.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm counting every minute,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>same as you, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is there any possibility...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know, some kind of a way</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we can maybe all jump in a black hole?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Gain back the years?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't shake your head at me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Time is relative, okay?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It can stretch</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and it can squeeze, but...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it can't run backwards. It just can't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The only thing that can move across</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>dimensions, like time, is gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The beings that led us here,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they communicate...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- ...through gravity, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Could they be talking to us</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from the future?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Maybe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Okay. If they can...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"They" are beings of five dimensions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To them, time might be</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>another physical dimension.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To them...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the past might be a canyon</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that they can climb into and the future...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a mountain they can climb up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But to us, it's not, okay?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- But you knew about relativity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>my daughter was 10 years old.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I couldn't teach her</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Einstein's theories before I left.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Couldn't you have told her</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you were going to save the world?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When you become a parent,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>one thing becomes really clear.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And that is that you want to make sure</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>your children feel safe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And it rules out telling a 10-year-old</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that the world is ending.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How long for the engines, CASE?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- A minute or two.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We don't have it. Helmets on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand, co-pilot, you're up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE, blow the cabin oxygen</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>through the main thrusters!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We're gonna spark it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Roger that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Locked.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Depressurizing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Engines up!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hello, Rom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've waited years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How...? How many years?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- By now it must be...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Twenty-three years...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>four months, eight days.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Doyle?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I thought I was prepared.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I knew the theory.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Reality's different.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And Miller?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's nothing here for us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why didn't you sleep?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, I had a couple of stretches.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But I stopped believing you were coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And something seemed wrong</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about dreaming my life away.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I learned what I could</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from the black hole...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I couldn't send anything</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to your father.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've been receiving,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but nothing gets out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Is he alive?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've got years of messages stored.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Messages span 23 years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Play it from the beginning.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Checking in. Saying hi.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Finished second in school.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Miss Kurling's still</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>giving me C's though.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa attended the ceremony.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I met another girl, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I really think this is the one.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Name's Lois. That's her right there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murphy stole Grandpa's car.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She crashed it. She's okay, though.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look at this!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're a grandpa.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>His name's Jesse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I kind of wanted to call him Coop,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but Lois says... maybe next time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Donald says he's already earned</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, dear. Oh, dear.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Sorry it's been a while.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what with Jesse and all.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Grandpa died last week.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We buried him out in the back forty</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>next to Mom and...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Jesse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Which is where we would have buried you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if you'd ever...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph was there at the funeral.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We don't see her that much,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but she came for that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You aren't listening to this,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I know that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All these messages are just, like...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>drifting out there in the darkness.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lois says that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have to let you go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I guess I'm letting you go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know where you are, Dad...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I hope that you're at peace.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Goodbye.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You son of a bitch.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I never made one of these</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when you were still responding...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because I was so mad at you for leaving.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And then when you went quiet, it...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>seemed like I should live with that decision.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I have.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But today's my birthday.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And it's a special one,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because you told me...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You once told me that when you came back,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we might be the same age.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And today I'm the age you were</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when you left.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So it would be a real good time</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for you to come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've never seen you in here before.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've never been in here before.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm glad you've started.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I haven't. I...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I just had something</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I needed to get out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I know they're still out there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There are so many reasons their</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>communications might not be getting through.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I know, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Them never coming back or...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>coming back to find we've failed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then let's succeed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>back to the fourth iteration.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's run it through some new fields.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>With respect, professor,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we've tried that hundreds of times.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It only has to work once, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Every rivet that they strike</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>could have been a bullet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've done well for the world here...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>whether or not we crack the equation</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>before I kick the bucket.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Don't be morbid, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm not afraid of death.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm an old physicist.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm afraid of time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're afraid of time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've been trying</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to solve the equation...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>without changing</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the underlying assumption about time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- And that means...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>each iteration is an attempt</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to prove its own proof.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's recursive. It's nonsensical.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Are you calling my life's work...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>nonsense, Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, I'm saying</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that you've been trying to...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>finish it with one arm...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, with both arms tied behind your back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I don't understand why.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm an old man, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Can we take this point up</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>at another time?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I want to talk to my daughter.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Stepping out into the universe...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we must confront the reality</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of interstellar travel.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We must reach far beyond</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>our own lifespans.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We must think not as individuals</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but as a species.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do not go gentle into that good night</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS kept the Endurance</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>right where we needed her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But the trip took years longer</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>than we anticipated.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We no longer have the fuel</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to visit both prospects, so...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we have to choose.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But how?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're both promising.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is the one still transmitting, so...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We've no reason to suspect</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Edmunds's data would have soured.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>His world has key elements</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to sustain human life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- As does Dr. Mann's.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper, this is my field.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I really believe Edmunds'</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is the better prospect.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Gargantua, that's why.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Look at Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but no life. Sterile.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We'll find the same thing on Mann's.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because of the black hole?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murphy's Law.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Whatever can happen will happen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Accident is the first building block</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of evolution.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But when you're orbiting a black hole</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>not enough can happen.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It sucks in asteroids and comets,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>other events which would otherwise reach you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We need to go further afield.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You once said that Dr. Mann...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>was the best of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's remarkable.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're only here because of him.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And yet... Yet here he is.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's on the ground, and he's sending</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a very unambiguous message,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>telling us to come to his planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Granted, but Edmunds' data</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is more promising.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We should vote.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, if we vote,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>there's something you should know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand? He has a right to know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That has nothing to do with it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What does?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Is that true?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And that makes me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>want to follow my heart.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But maybe we've spent too long trying</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to figure all this out with theory.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're a scientist, Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So listen to me...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when I say that love</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>isn't something we invented. It's...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>observable, powerful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It has to mean something.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>social bonding, child rearing...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We love people who have died.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where's the social utility in that?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>None.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe it means something more,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>something we can't...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>yet understand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe it's some evidence, some...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>artifact of a higher dimension</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that we can't consciously perceive.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm drawn across the universe</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to someone I haven't seen in a decade...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>who I know is probably dead.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Love is the one thing</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we're capable of perceiving...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that transcends dimensions</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of time and space.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe we should trust that,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>even if we can't understand it yet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>yes...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the tiniest possibility</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of seeing Wolf again excites me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That doesn't mean I'm wrong.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Honestly, Amelia...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it might.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We'll lose about a third again.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But next year...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and we'll make it up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What happened to Nelson?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, have you eaten enough?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Would you like some more souffle?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was delicious.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Coop, finish your fritter, please.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Will you spend the night? Your room</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is exactly as you left it. It's ready.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I need to get back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My sewing machine is in there,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but there's plenty...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I need to...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Too many memories.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We might have something for that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The dust.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lois, I have a friend who...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>could look at his lungs.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Amelia, I'm sorry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You were just being objective.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Unless you're punishing me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for screwing up on Miller's planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, this wasn't a personal decision.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If you're wrong, you will have</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a very personal decision to make.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Your fuel calculations</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>are based on a return journey.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to decide whether to return home...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Starting a colony could save us</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from extinction.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You might have to decide</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>between seeing your children again...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and the future of the human race.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I trust you'll be as objective then.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's been asking for you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>since he came to.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We were trying to reach you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm here, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I let you all down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, you got us so far. Real close.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll finish what you started.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Good, good Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You had faith...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>all those...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>all those years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I asked you to have faith.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I wanted you to believe...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that your father...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>would come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I do, professor.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Forgive me, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- There's nothing to forgive.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I... I lied, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I lied to you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There was no need for him to...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There is no way to help us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But Plan A...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All this. All these people.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And the equation.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did my father know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did he leave me?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>not...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>go...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>gentle...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You can't leave.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You... No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that your father died today. He had no pain.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He was at peace.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm very sorry for your loss.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand, did you know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He told you, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You knew.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This was all a sham.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You left us here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To suffocate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To starve.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Frozen cloud.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's okay. It's okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Pray you never learn...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just how good it can be</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to see another face.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I hadn't a lot of hope</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to begin with, but...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>after so long, I had none.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My supplies were completely exhausted.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The last time I went to sleep,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I didn't even set a waking date.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have literally raised me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from the dead.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lazarus.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What about the others?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm afraid you're it, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So far, surely.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, our present situation is that there's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>very little chance of rescuing any others.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Tell us about your world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Our world, we hope.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Our world... is cold...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>stark...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but undeniably beautiful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The days are 67 hours long, cold.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The nights are...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>67 far colder hours.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The gravity is a very, very pleasant</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>80 percent of the Earth's.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Now, up here where I landed,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the water is alkali...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and the air has too much ammonia to breathe</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for more than just a few minutes...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but down at the surface,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and there is a surface...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the chlorine dissipates.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The ammonia gives way to crystalline</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>hydrocarbons and breathable air.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To organics. Possibly even to life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We might be sharing this world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>These readings are from the surface?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Over the years,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've dropped various probes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How far have you explored?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I've mounted several major expeditions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But with oxygen in limited supply,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>KIPP there really did most of the legwork.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What went wrong with him, sir?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Degeneration.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He misidentified the first organics</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we found as ammonia crystals.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We struggled on for a time,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but ultimately I decommissioned him and...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>used his power source</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to keep the mission going.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I thought I was alone</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>before I shut him down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Would you like me to look at him?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. No. He needs a human touch.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for you from the comm station.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that your father died today.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He had no pain.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He was at peace.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is that Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's... She's grown.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand, did you know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He told you, right?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You knew.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This was all a sham.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You left us here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To suffocate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To starve.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did my father know too?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I just want to know...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if you left me here to die.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I just have to know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, my...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My father dedicated...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>his whole life to Plan A.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have no idea what she's talking about.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I do.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He never even hoped</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to get the people off the Earth?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But he's been trying to solve</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the gravity equation for 40 years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Amelia, your father solved his equation</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>before I even left.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then why wouldn't he use it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The equation couldn't reconcile relativity</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with quantum mechanics. You need more.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>More? More what?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>More data.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You need to see into a black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The laws of nature prohibit</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a naked singularity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly, is that true?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If a black hole is an oyster,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>then the singularity's the pearl inside.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The gravity's so strong, it's always</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's why we call it a black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, but if we see</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>beyond the horizon...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We can't, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There are some things</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that aren't meant to be known.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Your father had to find another way</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to save the human race from extinction.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Plan B. A colony.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why not tell people?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Why keep building those stations?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- He knew how hard it would be...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to get people to work together to save</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the species instead of themselves.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Or their children.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Bullshit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You never would've come here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>unless you believed you would save them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Evolution has yet to transcend</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that simple barrier.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We can care deeply,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>selflessly about those we know,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but that empathy rarely extends</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>beyond our line of sight.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But the lie.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That monstrous lie?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Unforgivable. And he knew that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He was prepared to destroy his own humanity</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in order to save the species.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- He made an incredible sacrifice.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>An incredible sacrifice is being made</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>by the people on Earth who are gonna die!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because in his fucking arrogance...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>he declared their case hopeless.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry, Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>their case is hopeless.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We are the future.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, what can I do?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let me go home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're absolutely positive?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>His solution was correct.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He'd had it for years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's worthless?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's half the answer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, how do you find the other half?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Out there? A black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- But stuck down here on Earth?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm not sure you can.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>God, they just pack up and leave.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What are they hoping to find?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Survival.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Damn it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, don't...?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't people have a right to know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Panic won't help. We just</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>have to keep working, same as ever.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>was manipulating us to do?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand gave up on us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm still trying to solve this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>do you have an idea?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A feeling.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I told you about my ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>My dad thought I called it a ghost...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because I was scared of it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But I was never scared of it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I called it a ghost because it felt...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It felt like a person.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was trying to tell me something.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If there's an answer here on Earth,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it's back there...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>somehow, in that room.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So I have to find it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're running out of time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, they can stay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll be sleeping anyway.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey, Coop?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have a suggestion</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for your return journey.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah, what's that?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Have one last crack at the black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm going home, Rom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, I know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This isn't going to cost you any time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's a chance for the people on Earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Talk to me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's what we call a gentle singularity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Gentle?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're hardly gentle.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But the tidal gravity is so quick that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>something crossing the horizon fast</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>might survive. A probe, say.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What happens after it crosses?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- After the horizon is a complete mystery.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So, what's to say</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>there isn't some way that the probe...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>can glimpse the singularity</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and relay the quantum data?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If he's equipped to transmit</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>every form of energy that can pulse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just when did this probe</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>become a "he," professor?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS is the obvious candidate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've already told him what to look for.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'd need the old optical transmitter</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>off KIPP, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You'd do this for us?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Before you get all teary, remember that</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>as a robot I have to do anything you say.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Your cue light's broken.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm not joking.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>some components from KIPP.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't want to disturb</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>his archival functions.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll supervise.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Once those modules have landed,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you don't want to move them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can take you to the probe sites,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I don't think...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>these conditions are gonna hold.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think we should wait.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE is headed down</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with the rest of the distillery equipment.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'd really like to secure</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>those sites by nightfall.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, these squalls do usually blow over.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, then.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You'll need a long-range transmitter.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Got it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Are you charged?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Follow me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- TARS, 72 hours, yeah?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Roger that, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand told me why you feel</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you have to go back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But I'd be remiss</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if I didn't at least mention...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that a mission such as ours</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>could certainly use an extra engineer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You better slow down, turbo.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Safety first, CASE, remember.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Safety first, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm honored to be a part of this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But once we set up base camp and secure</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>those modules, my work's done here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm going home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have attachments.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But even without a family...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can promise you that that yearning</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to be with other people is powerful.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That emotion is at the foundation...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of what makes us human.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's not to be taken lightly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How long have you had that cough?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- A while.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Mom lets me play in here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't touch your stuff.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just take this gently.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You know why we couldn't just send machines</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>on these missions, don't you, Cooper?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A machine doesn't improvise well</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because you can't program a fear of death.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Our survival instinct is our single</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>greatest source of inspiration.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Take you, for example.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A father...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with a survival instinct</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that extends to your kids.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What does research tell us is the last thing</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you're going to see before you die?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Your children. Their faces.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>At the moment of death, your mind's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>gonna push a little bit harder to survive.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>For them.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Deep breath.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hey. I bet you're Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why don't you have a seat here for me?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's bad. They cannot stay here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Okay?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, what's taking so long?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Professor, I am having trouble</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>completing the boot up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't understand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's funny.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>When I left Earth...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I thought I was prepared to die.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The truth is...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I never really considered the possibility</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that my planet wasn't the one.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nothing worked out the way</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>it was supposed to.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right, buddy,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>give me a big deep breath.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What is this?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What are you doing?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're gonna need it</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to complete the mission...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>once the others realize</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what this place isn't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We cannot survive here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- They can't stay here anymore.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You have to leave right now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let me make something abundantly clear.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have a responsibility...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh! Jesus!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad didn't raise you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to be this dumb, Tom!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You faked all the data?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's no surface?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I tried to do my duty, Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I knew the day that I arrived here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that this place had nothing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And I resisted</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the temptation for years...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I knew that...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>if I just pressed that button, then...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>somebody would come and save me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You fucking coward.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Listen, if you're not going to go,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>let your family go. Just save your family.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And we go live underground with you?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Pray that Daddy comes to save us?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad's not coming back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He never was coming back. It's up to me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're gonna save everybody?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because Dad couldn't do it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad didn't even try!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad just abandoned us!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He left us here to die.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nobody's going with you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You gonna wait for your next kid to die?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And don't come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You can keep my stuff.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Stop it!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. No!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you're gonna kill yourself!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Those are the best odds</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I've had in years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't judge me, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You were never tested like I was.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Few men have been.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You tried your best, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're feeling it, aren't you?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The survival instinct.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's what drove me. It's what drives</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because I want to save all of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>For you, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry, I can't watch you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>go through this. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I thought I could, but I can't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm here. I'm here for you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just listen to my voice, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm right here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You're not alone.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do you see your children?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're right there with you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did Professor Brand tell you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that poem before you left?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do you remember?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do not go gentle into that good night</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Old age should burn and rave</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>At close of day</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Rage, rage against</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the dying of the light</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand! Help!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Help!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No air.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Ammonia.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I have a fix.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Go! Go, go, go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And away!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, we're coming.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Hang in there. Don't talk.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Try to breathe as little as possible.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're almost there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's a security lockout, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It requires a person to access function.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's all yours, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Try not to breathe.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're coming. We're coming right now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE, come on! Come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We got to go faster, CASE!</p>

  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This data makes no sense.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Mann was lying!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go. Go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Step back, professor! Step back!</p>

  <p class='subtitle'>Keep watch!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lois?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What happened to caution, CASE?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Safety first, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Brand. Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There's been an explosion.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann's compound.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let me know when TARS is aboard.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Romilly did not survive.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I could not save him.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- TARS is in.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- I'll take her now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- He's pushing into orbit!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If he takes control</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of that ship, we're dead.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- He'd maroon us?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- He is marooning us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'll meet you guys downstairs.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Go wait by the car.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on! Give me your bag.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!</p>

  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know what he said to you...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but I am taking command</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of the Endurance.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And then we can talk</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about completing the mission.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dr. Mann, listen to me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is not about my life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Or Cooper's life.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This is about all mankind.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There is a moment...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It is not sa...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, my God.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- There's no point using fuel to chase...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Analyze the Endurance's spin.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper, what are you doing?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Docking.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, get ready to match our spin</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with the retro thrusters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- It's not possible.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- No... it's necessary.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Endurance is hitting stratosphere!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's got no heat shield.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- CASE, you ready?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ready.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper! This is no time for caution.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>CASE, if I black out,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>you take the stick.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, get ready to engage</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the docking mechanism.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Endurance is starting to heat.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Twenty feet out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Ten feet out.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, we are lined up.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Initiating spin!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on, TARS.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on, TARS!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- We are locked, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Locked. Easing up!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Easy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Easy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Retro thrusters!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Main engines on.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Killing main engines!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, we're out of orbit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. And for our next trick!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It'll have to be good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're heading into Gargantua's pull.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, shit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- CASE, take the stick.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Roger that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Shall I use main engines?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. We got to let her slide</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>as far as we can.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Give it to me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- There's good news, there's bad news.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Give it to me straight.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The backup generator kicked in,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so the system's stable. They're all good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Good.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. The navigational hub</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>has been completely destroyed.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We don't have enough life support</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to make it back to Earth, but...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think we can scratch our way</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to Edmunds' planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What about fuel?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Not enough. But I have a plan.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We let Gargantua pull us down</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>close to her horizon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Then a powered slingshot around,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>launching us towards Edmunds' planet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Manually?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- That's what I'm here for.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna take us</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just inside the critical orbit.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What about time slippage?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Neither of us has time to worry...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sorry, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Once we've gathered</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>enough speed around Gargantua...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we use Lander 1...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>push us out of the black hole's gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Lender's linkages</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>have been destroyed...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so we'll have to control manually.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Once Lander 1 is spent,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS will detach...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And get sucked into that black hole.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Why does TARS have to detach?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We have to shed the weight</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to escape the gravity.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Newton's third law.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The only way humans have ever</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>figured out of getting somewhere...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is to leave something behind.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, you can't ask TARS</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to do this for us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's a robot. So you don't have</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to ask him to do anything.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Cooper, you asshole!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's our only chance</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to save people on Earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If I can find a way to transmit</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the quantum data I'll find in there...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they might still make it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Let's just hope</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>there's still someone there to save.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maximum velocity achieved.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Prepare to fire escape thrusters.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ready?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ready.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ready.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Main engine ignition in three...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>two...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>one. Mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on, baby.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lander 1 engines, on my mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Three, two...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>one. Mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Three, two, one...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Fire!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>This little maneuver's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>gonna cost us 51 years!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Three, two...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- one. Mark.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Detach!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Goodbye, TARS.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- See you on the other side, Coop.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- See you there, Slick!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, CASE.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Nice reckless flying!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Learned from the master.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- What?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Newton's third law.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You got to leave something behind.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You told me we had enough resources</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for both of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We agreed, Amelia...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>90 percent.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Detach.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay, I am nosing down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Approaching the event horizon.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Portside, dipping down beneath it</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to go through it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Heading towards blackness.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have a visual of the event.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's all black.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, do you read me? It's all blackness.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS! Do you read me? Over.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Screens...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>getting interference.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Losing control of the stick.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I got flashes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Flashes of lightness and blackness.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The turbulence in the gravity</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>is increasing.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The computers are going down. Agh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Gravitational pull.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm losing control of the stick.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph? Murph, come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eject. Eject.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eject.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eject.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eject.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eject.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph! Murph! Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, no, no!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph! No! No!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If you're leaving, just go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, no. No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't go!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Morse. Morse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Morse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dot. Dot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>S.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>T.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dash!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dash! Dash!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, we don't have time for this!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Y.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"Stay!"</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's it say? What's it say, Murph?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What's it say?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"Stay."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Tell him, Murph. Make him stay.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Make him stay, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Make him stay, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't let me leave, Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't let me leave, Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No! No! No!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You were my ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- TARS?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Roger that.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- You survived.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Somewhere...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in their fifth dimension.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They saved us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>And just why would they want to help us?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't know, but they constructed</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>this three-dimensional space...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>inside their five-dimensional reality</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to allow you to understand it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, that ain't working.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes, it is.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You've seen that time is represented here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>as a physical dimension.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You have worked out that you can exert</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>a force across space-time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Gravity to send a message.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Affirmative.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Gravity...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>can cross the dimensions, including time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Apparently.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Do you have the quantum data?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Roger. I have it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but nothing is getting out, Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I can do this. I can do this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But such complicated data to a child?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not just any child.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What else? Oh, come on, Dad.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, the fire's out! Come on!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Even if you communicate it here,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>she won't understand its significance for years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I get that, TARS.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But we've got to figure something out</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they didn't bring us here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to change the past.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Say that again.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They didn't bring us here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to change the past.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No, they didn't bring us here at all.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We brought ourselves.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, give me the coordinates</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>for NASA in binary.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>In binary. Roger. Feeding data.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"It's not a ghost."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>"It's gravity."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't you get it yet, TARS?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I brought myself here!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're here to communicate</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with the three-dimensional world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We're the bridge!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I thought they chose me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- For what, Cooper?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>To save the world.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All of this is one little girl's bedroom.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Every moment.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's infinitely complex.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They have access to infinite time and space,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but they're not bound by anything!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They can't find a specific place in time.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They can't communicate.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's why I'm here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just like I found this moment.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- How, Cooper?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Love, TARS, love.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's just like Brand said. My connection</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What are we here to do?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Find how to tell her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The watch.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The watch.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>That's it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We code the data into the movement</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of the second hand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>TARS, translate the data into Morse</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>and feed it to me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Translating data to Morse.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, what if she never came back for it?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She will. She will.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Murph, I can see his car!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He's coming, Murph!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Okay. I'm coming down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How do you know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because I gave it to her.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dot-dot...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>dash-dot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dot-dash-dot-dot.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dash-dash-dash.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dash, dash, dash.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>He came back!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was him all the time!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I didn't know. It was him!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Dad's gonna save us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eureka!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's traditional.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Eureka!</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Did it work?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I think it might have.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How do you know?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because the bulk beings</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>are closing the tesseract.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Don't you get it yet, TARS?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're not "beings."</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They're us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What I've been doing for Murph,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>they're doing for me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>For all of us.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper, people couldn't build this.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No. No, not yet.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But one day.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Not you and me. But people.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>A civilization that's evolved past</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>the four dimensions we know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What happens now?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Mr. Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>All right. Let's take it slow, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Actually, you are 124 years old.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Take it slow, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You were... extremely lucky.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The Rangers found you with only minutes</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>left in your oxygen supply.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where am I?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper Station.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Currently orbiting Saturn.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Cooper Station.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nice of you to name it after me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>What?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The station isn't named after you, sir.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It's... named after your daughter.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Although she's always maintained</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just how important you were.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is she still alive?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She'll be here in a couple weeks.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She is far too old to be transferring</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>from another station...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but when she heard</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that you'd been found...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>well, this is... Murphy Cooper</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we're talking about.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes, it is.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We'll have you checked out of here</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in a couple days.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm sure you'll be excited to see</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>what's in store.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I actually... did a paper on you</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in high school.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I know all about your life</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>back on Earth.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Right.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>If... If you'll follow me,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we've got a really good situation for you.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>So... when I made my suggestion</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>to Miss Cooper...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I was delighted to hear</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>that she thought it was perfect.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was just constant.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Just that steady blow of dirt.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Of course,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I didn't speak to her personally.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We always set the plate upside-down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Glasses or cups,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>whatever it was, upside-down.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, my dad was a farmer.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Like everybody else back then.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>There just wasn't enough food.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>We wore little things, little strips...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>of sheet over our nose and mouth</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, it was pretty exciting for me</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>because it was hope.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't care who describes it, there is</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>no way for it to be exaggerated.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She did confirm</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>just how much you loved farming.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh, she did, did she?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah. Come here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Home sweet home.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Everything replaced and put back where it...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Hey, is this...?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Oh, yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>The machine we found out near Saturn</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>when we found you. Yes.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Its... power source was shot,</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>but we could get you another one.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yes. Please.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Settings.</p>

  <p class='subtitle'>- You want 55?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Is this really what it was like?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I don't care much for this pretending</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>we're back where we started.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I want to know where we are.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where we're going.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>- Yeah.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Family?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You told them I like farming.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>It was me, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I was your ghost.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I know.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>People didn't believe me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>They thought that I was doing it all myself.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I knew who it was.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Nobody believed me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>But I knew you'd come back.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>How?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Because my dad promised me.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Well, I'm here now, Murph.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I'm here.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>No parent should have to watch</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>their own child die.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>I have my kids here for me now.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>You go.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Where?</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Brand.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>She's out there...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>setting up camp.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Alone...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in a strange galaxy.</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>Maybe right now</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>she's settling in for the long nap...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>by the light of our new sun...</p>
  <p class='subtitle'>in our new home.</p>
